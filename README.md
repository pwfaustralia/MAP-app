## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. `git clone https://github.com/pwfaustralia/map-app`
2. `cd map-app/app`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`

## Build

1. `cd app`
2. `npm run build`
3. `docker-compose up -d` - you don't need to run this if you already have the container in docker.
4. The build version will be exposed in `localhost:5173`.
